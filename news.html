                    Today at the official Casa Milan Store, the beating heart of
                    the Rossoneri's world, dozens of fans were able to meet
                    midfielder Sandro Tonali in person. The midfielder was there
                    to chat, sign jerseys and gadgets and take some memorable
                    photos with the fans. Among the opportunities provided by
                    the club to take part in the event, fans were able to get
                    involved in the RE:JERSEY recycling project, launched by
                    PUMA to promote production models that ensure greater
                    sustainability through end-to-end recycling methods. At the
                    Casa Milan Store last week, fans were able to return an old
                    item of clothing made of 100% polyester, which will be
                    reused for the production of new garments, in exchange for a
                    space at the event.

                    The team were busy at Milanello ahead of the season
                    restarting It was a morning at Milanello for the Rossoneri,
                    who gathered for breakfast before heading into the dressing
                    room for today's training session. Paolo Maldini and
                    Frederic Massara were also present at the Centro Sportivo.
                    The group immediately took to the central pitch for the
                    warm-up phase, carried out with some athletic exercises with
                    the low hurdles and cones. Training continued with the group
                    engaged in an aerobic circuit that preceded a series of
                    technical exercises; before returning to the dressing rooms,
                    the group had the usual training match on a reduced pitch.
                    Tomorrow's programme includes a morning training session.

                    Spain playing in the round of 16 against Morocco: let's
                    remember a 2010 World Cup clash with the former Rossoneri
                    Fernando Torres was, at the time, one of the most successful
                    strikers of his generation - he is one of six players in
                    history to have won the Champions League, Europa League,
                    European Championship and World Cup - but also a splendid
                    talent not always expressed at 100 %. His is a career marked
                    by goals: many, but not always as many as the predictions
                    suggested at the beginning of his career, after a remarkable
                    development in Atlético Madrid's youth academy. He became
                    their youngest ever debutant, in 2001, and also the earliest
                    captain in history at the age of 19 in 2003. That same year
                    El Niño made his debut with the Spanish national team - in a
                    friendly against Portugal - and a few months later, in April
                    2004, came his first goal against Italy. That Bel Paese he
                    then tasted for a few months, as a player much more mature
                    in age, with the AC Milan shirt in the 2014/15 season.
