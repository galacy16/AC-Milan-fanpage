                <p class="font1">
                    Associazione Calcio Milan, commonly referred to as AC Milan
                    or simply Milan, is a professional football club in Milan,
                    Italy, founded in 1899. The club has spent its entire
                    history, with the exception of the 1980&#45;81 and
                    1982&#45;83 seasons, in the top flight of Italian football,
                    known as Serie A since 1929&#45;30. AC Milan's 18 FIFA and
                    UEFA trophies is the fourth highest out of any club (joint
                    with Boca Juniors), and the most out of any Italian club.
                    Milan has won a joint record three Intercontinental Cups and
                    one FIFA Club World Cup, seven European Cup/Champions League
                    titles (Italian record), the UEFA Super Cup a joint record
                    five times and the Cup Winners' Cup twice. With 18 league
                    titles, Milan is the third most successful club in Serie A,
                    behind local rivals Inter Milan (19 league titles) and
                    Juventus (36 league titles). They have also won the Coppa
                    Italia five times, and the Supercoppa Italiana seven.
                    Milan's home games are played at San Siro, also known as the
                    Stadio Giuseppe Meazza. The stadium, which is shared with
                    city rivals Internazionale, is the largest in Italian
                    football, with a total capacity of 75,923. They have a
                    long-standing rivalry with Inter, with whom they contest the
                    Derby della Madonnina; it is one of the most followed
                    derbies in football. The club is one of the wealthiest in
                    Italian and world football.It was a founding member of the
                    now-defunct G-14 group of Europe's leading football clubs as
                    well as its replacement, the European Club Association.

                    These were the words that Herbert Kilpin used as he founded
                    AC Milan on 16 December 1899. Just a year and a half later,
                    the Rossoneri became the champions of Italy for the first
                    time after beating Genoa 3-0 at Ponte Carrega on 5 May 1901.
                    The first celebration took place at AC Milan's first
                    headquarters, the Fiaschetteria Toscana on Via Berchet in
                    Milan, in 1899. Words, places and dates that gave rise to
                    the Rossoneri&#39;s glorious history. This is a Club that
                    has contributed hugely to the world of football, so much so
                    that AC Milan held the most international titles recognised
                    by FIFA from December 2007 to February 2014. The
                    Rossoneri&#39;s history is now the stuff of legend, as are
                    the men who have helped to write it &#45; be they
                    presidents, coaches or footballers. There have been so many
                    historic figures, from the Englishman Alfred Edwards, under
                    whom the Club won its first league title, and Andrea
                    Rizzoli, the first President of AC Milan and an Italian team
                    to win the European Cup in 1963 at Wembley, through to
                    Silvio Berlusconi, the President who had the most success in
                    Italy, Europe and throughout the world.

                    It is also possible to recognise a great club through its
                    playing culture in particular, by the style it promotes, by
                    the way it carries itself, by the innovative drive given to
                    it by its leaders. It&#39;s no coincidence that various
                    Rossoneri victories over various eras and different decades
                    have brought about new visions about how football should be
                    played. And those sitting on the AC Milan bench have been
                    key to this: the greatest coaches of Italian football have
                    all taken charge of the Rossoneri. Gipo Viani, Nereo Rocco
                    and Nils Liedholm paved the way for Arrigo Sacchi, Fabio
                    Capello and Carlo Ancelotti, the latter trio inheriting
                    incredible legacies while looking to play a modern,
                    spectacular brand of football. During the historic years
                    under Berlusconi's presidency, Arrigo Sacchi was hugely
                    successful and innovated not only thanks to great players,
                    but also thanks to what could be considered as an extra man:
                    the Game he played. Fabio Capello then took over, providing
                    continuity as the winning culture continued. Under Sacchi,
                    AC Milan won one Scudetto, two European Cups, two European
                    Super Cups and two Intercontinental Cups, winning all the
                    international finals they were involved in. And it was that
                    extra man, the Game, that brought the best out of
                    individuals and led to three Rossoneri players occupying the
                    top three places in the Ballon d&#39;Or in 1988 (Van Basten,
                    Gullit and Rijkaard) and 1989 (Van Basten, Baresi and
                    Rijkaard).
